Project Setup
To run this project locally, you will need to set up both the backend server and the frontend application.

1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up your environment variables:

Create a file named .env in the backend directory.

IMPORTANT: This file contains sensitive information and is ignored by Git (via the .gitignore file). It should never be committed to a public repository.

Add the following variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=kce
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

Set up the database:

Open MySQL Workbench and create a new schema named kce.

Run the complete SQL script located in your project to create all the necessary tables.

Start the server:

npm start

The server will be running on http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the application:

npm start

The React application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

3. Creating an Admin User (Required for Admin Panel Access)
Sign up normally through the application's UI with an email you want to designate for admin use.

Manually grant admin privileges by running the following command in MySQL Workbench. Replace the email with the one you just used.

UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';

Log out of the application and then log back in with the admin account to access the /admin panel.
